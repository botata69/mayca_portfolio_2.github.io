            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hi everyone, I’m Xinamayca de Cuba, though you can call me Mayca. <br> <br>
    
                This semester has been an exhilarating journey for me in <br>
                design. I’m incredibly proud of how much I’ve learned,<br>
                especially with the freedom to explore the world of UX/UI <br>
                here at Fonty's. <br> <br>
                
                Outside of my design pursuits, I’m passionate about maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Exercise is a big part of my routine, and I strive to nourish my body with nutritious foods. Taking care of myself is a priority.
                Music is another significant aspect of my life, and I’m eager to immerse myself in the vibrant events that Europe has to offer. <br> <br>
                
                When crafting my portfolio, I aimed to reflect my personality—a blend of chill vibes and positivity. It serves as a showcase for my newfound skills and represents who I am as a designer.</p>
