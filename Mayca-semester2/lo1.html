                            I learned to understand who my users are and to test my media 
                            creations and get feedback to make sure they're easy to use and 
                            meet everyone's needs. Not only the users but also the stakeholders, 
                            this ensures they receive a product that is successful and meets

                        our rebranding efforts met these needs, my team member Shirine conducted

                            Utilizing the DOT framework, we focused on field research 
                            by conducting a 9-question survey aimed at 15 potential 
                            users in Eindhoven. We specifically targeted furniture 
                            stores and libraries, as these locations are frequented 
                            by individuals interested in home decor and potentially art enthusiasts.

                            The insights gained from our field research were crucial in

                            the importance of data-driven decision-making in creating a
