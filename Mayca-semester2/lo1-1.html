                    <p>Utilizing the DOT framework, we focused on field research by conducting a 
                        survey among international students. This research aimed to identify 
                        the specific attractions in Breda, such as historic places and restaurants, 
                        that appeal to our target audience. Additionally, we aimed to identify the 
                        most popular social media platforms among these students to optimize our 
                        marketing efforts.</p>

                            The survey included questions about our target 
                            audiences interests in various attractions and 
                            social media usage. Based on the survey results, 
                            we developed a content strategy that included 
                            visually engaging posts, short videos and 
                            interactive stories.

                        The insights gained from our field research enabled us to 
                        create a targeted and effective marketing campaign. 
                        By aligning our content with the interests and online 
                        behaviors of international students, we ensured a higher 
                        engagement rate and a stronger connection with our 
                        audience. More of this can be found in LO3.
