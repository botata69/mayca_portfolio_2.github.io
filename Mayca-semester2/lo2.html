                            Through Ahmer's workshop, I was able to discover multiple development 
                            concepts crucial to front-end development. This included hands-on 
                            experience with various front-end development languages, such as 
                            HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. In this section, I showcase my work 
                            and the experiments I conducted during his workshops, highlighting 
                            my favorite ones.

                                In class, we created a Pokémon using only colored squares with CSS. 
                                This project allowed me to practice my CSS skills in 
                                positioning and alignment.

                                Building a Tic Tac Toe game using only HTML, CSS, and plain JavaScript 
                                was a great beginner project to practice my web development skills. 
                                Thankfully Amer handed us a very usefull reader that we could follow 
                                the exact steps for creating this game.

                            Creating a Pokémon game using the PokéAPI has provided valuable experience in using RESTful APIs, 
                            developing web applications with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and managing an interactive project.
