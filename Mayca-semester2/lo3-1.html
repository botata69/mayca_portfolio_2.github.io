                    <p>Handpicked tasked us with creating a marketing campaign for Explorebreda.nl,
                        an online platform showcasing the best of Breda. Our research revealed that
                        international students mostly use social media platforms such as instagram
                        and tiktok. This insight alowed my team and I to focus on content creation
                        for these specific platforms. </p>

                        <p>
                            We focused on creating short, snappy videos, each under
                            30 seconds to maintain viewers' attention spans. <br><br>

                            Each video was designed to complement our flyers.
                            Our slogan, "Don't know where to go? We'll help you
                            find your way," is prominently featured in all our
                            content to ensure consistency. <br> <br>

                            skit #1 (part 1) <br>
                            In our first skit, I came up with the idea
                            to feature our actor traveling to Breda for the
                            first time. Upon arrival, she realizes she doesnâ€™t
                            know where to go. <br><br>

                            skit #2 (part 2) <br>
                            Two new actors appear, to help the lost newcomer
                            find her way in Breda, connecting it to skit 1.
                            The slogan is mentioned in the song to maintain
                            consistency across our content. At the end of
                            the music video, a disco ball appears, linking
                            our flyer to the video.

                            skit #3 <br>
                            Inspired by a HEMA commercial, this skit grabs attention with an unexpected 
                            scenario before smoothly transitioning to our intended message. <br><br>
