                                This learning outcome has allowed me to deeply reflect
                                on my core values and identify what matters most to me.

                                <span class="first-word">Learning</span> is a fundamental value in my life.
                                I maintain a constant desire to learn and explore,
                                continually educating myself and remaining open to
                                new ideas and perspectives. This commitment to
                                learning not only enhances my knowledge but also
                                keeps me adaptable in an ever-changing world.

                                <span class="first-word">Creativity</span> is another core value that I hold dear. It allows me to generate original
                                ideas and engage in creative thinking. Through my designs, I express myself and bring
                                innovative concepts to life. My journey in Media and Design has provided numerous
                                opportunities to practice and display my creativity, showing its importance in
                                my personal and professional development.

                                <span class="first-word">Compassion</span>  is the value that is closest to my heart. Compassion includes kindness,
                                showing care and consideration for others, and being dedicated to service.
                                It involves a willingness to give time, resources, and support to those in need.
                                Being kind is paramount to me, and it guides my interactions and decisions.
                                While I may not yet know exactly what kind of designer I will become, I
                                am certain that I will pursue my career with kindness, creating work that
                                helps others and provides a meaningful, fulfilling experience.

                                In summary, learning, creativity, and compassion are the core values that define me.
                                They shape my approach to both life and work, ensuring that whatever I do, I do it with
                                a
                                sense of purpose, empathy, and a continuous drive for growth.

                                To find out more about myself I conducted the 16 personalities test. 
                                I discovered that I am an ENFP-T which is a Campaigner. I did not know about 
                                this test so to read it describe me was kind of weird but In a good way. 
                                I like the person that I am becoming. This test helped me understand myself 
                                better and was definitely a nice experience towards growth.

                                companies from the Caribbean, 1 being a tech company. 
                                Fred was focused on solly caribbean companies as they try to take back their brain drain.
