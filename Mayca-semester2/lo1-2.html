                    <p>Bula Surf Shop currently does not have a live webshop, 
                        limiting their product visibility to in-store visitors. 
                        As a local studying abroad, I recognize the need for an 
                        online platform that allows customers to stay connected
                         with the shopâ€™s offerings, browse products, view prices, 
                         and make purchases from anywhere in the world. For this project, 
                         I conducted field research with my target audience and developed 
                         an interactive prototype. </p>

                            I conducted a survey of my two target audiences: 
                            local and international Bula customers. This 
                            research aimed to gather insights on user needs, 
                            preferences, and behaviors to create a user-centric 
                            and functional webshop. Additionally, it aimed to 
                            determine if having a webshop was necessary for
                            Bula and if customers would use it.

                        Research revealed that most users prefer mobile devices 
                        for online shopping. Based on this finding, 
                        I focused on developing a mobile app for Bula 
                        instead of a traditional webshop. Additionally, 
                        the research indicated that both local and international 
                        customers would be interested in online shopping at Bula.

                            I developed an interactive prototype using Adobe XD, 
                            which allowed me to test and interact with it on my phone. 
                            This tool enabled me to create a realistic and functional model of the mobile app, 
                            ensuring a user-friendly design and experience. The prototype included key 
                            features such as product browsing, price viewing, and a seamless checkout process.
